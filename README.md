Hey folks, welcome to my project of Movie Recommendation System using NLP, TF-IDF and fast api.The model has been created and multiple pickle files have been generated for our use. Then, Using PyCharm I have made main.py where the code
for backend deployment has been designed and successfully deployed on Render. Then, in app.py the code for the streamlit app has been designed and successfully deployed on streamlit 
community cloud. In the requirements.txt file the requirements have been listed for this specific project and runtime.txt signifies the specific python version used for this task.


It was a great time developing this project and learning fastapi and backend deployment which can be put to a good use. Hope you like this one:)
